# Test run of VTK-logger by MW - Adapted from Tomek

# ### INSTRUCTIONS ###
"""
1. Set the directories with which the script should work:
"""
# Root directory of the eGFRD algorithm files:
# Use the full path (e.g. NOT a tilde)
egfrd_directory ='/storage1/wehrens/myfork_egfrd/'
# Output directory of the VTK logger 
# (This was defined when calling the logger in your
# script.)
simulation_data_directory = egfrd_directory + \
    'samples/cluster/VTK_out_1/'
"""

2. Start ParaView. Make sure you give Paraview the PYTHONPATH 
   information:

    This means, in bash:
    $ export PYTHONPATH=/usr/lib/paraview/
    $ paraview

3. In ParaView, select tools > python shell > run script. Then
   select this script. If everything went well, you've now 
   imported the data correctly in ParaView.
