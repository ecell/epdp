Introduction
=====================================
This example deals with the rebinding problem. The simplest case of
this probllem is when you have two particles of different species
that can react with each other, say A and B, to a particle of species
C:

A + B <-> C

If all these particles have different diffusion constants, one may 
wonder how the path of the center of mass of this particle system 
can be approximated by a single diffusion constant.

A major question in this problem is how many time the particles 
spend being particles A & B, and how many time the particles spend
as particle C.

Here, such a system is simulated. There is one particle A, and a 
fixed number of particles B, which can react to a particle C. 
Additionally there are some particles X that are inert.

The simulation initially places a particle A and a particle B next
to it. If the number of particles B >1 then the rest of the B-particles
are placed at random positions. (But can still be bound by particle A.)

Running
=====================================
The simulation can be run as follows:
$ LOGLEVEL=ERROR PYTHONPATH=../.. python -O run.py [N_B] [N_X] [N] [t1,
t2, t3, t4, .., INF]

Example:
$ LOGLEVEL=ERROR PYTHONPATH=../.. python -O run.py 1 100 10 1.0 2.5 3 4.0 INF

Here, N_B and N_X are respectively the number of B and X particles. N is the 
number of times the simulation is ran. [t1, t2, .., INF] is an array of times 
at which the distances between the two particles are logged. (Taken zero if a 
set of A and B particles have reacted to a C particle.) This array should 
minimally contain the INF value.
    If only [INF] is given as input, the simulation will run until it 
has recorded a duration for which the particles were in a bound state.
Otherwise, the system will keep going untill all measurement times have 
been passed (and then still run until a duration is recorded). 


Output
=====================================
The most important data is written away to files in the data directory.

The duration of recorded bindings are written to:
rebind_t.dat

The distances between the particles logged at times given by the user 
are written to:
rebind_r_<time>.dat
(Where <time> stands for the applicable measurement time.)


Appendix
=====================================

Some code used in previous versions:

100 nM = 100e-9 * N_A * 100 / m^3 = 6.02e19
V = 1 / 6.02e19 = 1.66e-20 m^3
L = 2.55e-7 m

1 uM = 6.02e20 / m^3
V = 1.66e-21 m^3
L = 1.18e-7
