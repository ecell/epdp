Prerequisites
-------------------------

1. autotools (autoconf >=2.50, automake >=1.11, libtool (>=2.2.6) or later.
2. GNU Scientific Library (GSL) 1.11 or later.
3. Boost C++ Library 1.37 or later.
4. Python 2.4 or later.
5. Scipy 0.5 or later, Numpy 1.0 or later.

If you use Fedora or any other RedHat lines of linux, check
if the following RPM packages are installed:

autoconf automake libtool gcc-c++ gsl gsl-devel boost boost-devel python scipy numpy


On Ubuntu Linux and some other Debian families, install the following:

autoconf automake autotools-dev libtool gsl-bin libgsl0-dev libboost-all-dev python-scipy python-numpy 


In addition to above, optionally also install packages:

python-matplotlib python-h5py pychecker


A note on GSL version
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

GSL version 1.10 and earlier has at least two bugs that can cause abnormal
program exits when a Bessel function is evaluated with specific argument
values.  These bugs can hit stability of this software.
For this reason, use of GSL version 1.11 or later is recommended.


Building this package
-------------------------

1. ./autogen.sh
2. ./configure
3. make

has been tested on:
Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
Debian 7.7.0
Fedora 20.1
CentOS 7.0.14.06



Testing
-------------------

% make check

checks if some of the core components of the software run correctly.

In addition, you may run

% make pycheck

if you want to be super-strict about Python syntax.


Running
-------------------------

Go to subdirectories under doc/samples, and read README files 
included about how to run the samples.
